      <div class="boxContainer">
        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Concept</h3>
          <p class="desc">Inspired by Scythe by Neal Shusterman, this animation explores the emotional weight of a scythe’s existence—torn between duty and longing. The protagonist, bound by their role as a bringer of death, struggles with the isolation their position demands.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Style & Technique</h3>
          <p class="desc">This piece is not traditional animation but frame-based storytelling. Instead of smooth movement, the sequence unfolds through dissolving still frames, emphasizing the weight of time and decision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Story & Visuals</h3>
          <p class="desc">A scythe walks down a dim corridor, approaching a desk. Lights fade—only one name remains illuminated, signaling the next victim. Ghostly figures appear, surrounding the scythe as guilt takes hold. Moving to a window, the scythe reaches out toward a passing figure, only to pull away, knowing they can never form real connections.</p>

          <h3 class="subtitle">Voice-over</h3>
          <p class="desc">A poetic narration reinforces the theme of loneliness, using symbolic phrasing rather than direct storytelling. Something along the lines of: "I write their names... scars fill the epiderm. Unbearable memories... one more, one more, one more. I long for warmth, yet I stand against the cold wall of solitude."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle"> Challenges & Process</h3>
          <p class="desc">The animation started with blocking out rough shapes, ensuring the composition and pacing conveyed the right emotions before refining the models. A 10mm lens was chosen to enhance the overwhelming presence of guilt (ghosts appearing in the frame).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Reflection</h3>
          <p class="desc">The challenge was to express deep emotion with minimal animation, using light, shadow, and composition to tell a story. Does a fading light revealing a name feel too predictable? Maybe—but its simplicity allows the weight of the moment to sink in.</p>

        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Style & Technique</h3>
          <p class="desc">This 3D animation employs dynamic camera movements to capture the spaceship's motion as it navigates around the rotating space station. The camera tracks the ship at various points, creating a sense of immersion and excitement. The AI's dialogue contrasts the intricate calculations happening behind the scenes with the serene exterior, emphasizing how much we take advanced technology for granted.</p>

        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Story & Visuals</h3>
          <p class="desc">The storyline follows the spaceship's return to the space station. The visuals focus on the ship's approach, the docking sequence, and the interaction between the spaceship and the station’s AI. The station spins slowly, adding to the challenge of the docking maneuver. The camera angles vary to highlight the ship's trajectory, the station's rotating structure, and the overall complexity of the process.</p>

        <div class="infoBox">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Techniques & Process</h3>
          <p class="desc">The background was tracked in Blender to integrate the 3D elements seamlessly. Afterward, the elements were moved to After Effects to add effects such as the ring of warped-space created when the spaceship enters the atmosphere. The integration of 3D elements with real-world footage was meticulously handled to ensure realism.</p>

      <p class="descr">Set in a stark, dim environment, this scene captures the essence of a blacksmith’s forge. The radiant glow of the forge serves as the only source of light, casting dramatic shadows over a weathered table. On this table lie the essential tools of the craft—a battle hammer, a sword accented with a delicate piece of jade at its pommel, and a set of traditional clippers—arranged against a sturdy anvil. The interplay of light and shadow creates an atmosphere that speaks to both the art of creation and the enduring legacy of craftsmanship.</p>
